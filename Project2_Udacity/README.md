# Landing Page Project

## Project Overview

This project involves building a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. The page makes use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to manage interactivity and styling. The navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list depending on the content of the webpage.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navigation**: The navigation bar is built dynamically as an unordered list.
- **Section Active State**: Highlights the section currently in view on the page.
- **Scroll to Section**: Clicking on a navigation item scrolls to the appropriate section smoothly.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop by using responsive web design principles.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient JavaScript and CSS practices that ensure smooth performance across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
